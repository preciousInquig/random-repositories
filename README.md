# Random Repositories

This repository is a collection of my old projects that was created for fun and entertainment.
Instead of keeping them in separate repos, I moved them here for better organization and reference.  

## Purpose
This repository is **for school purposes only**.  
It serves as a portfolio of my early coding projects and practice exercises.
